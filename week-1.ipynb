    "## Introduction to Managing Spatial Tables with Iceberg\n",
    "\n",
    "Wherobots extends Apache Iceberg — a modern open table format — to natively support spatial data.\n",
    "This allows you to manage vector and raster datasets just like any other analytical table, with the same reliability, scalability, and query optimization benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a data engineer, this means you can use familiar tools (SQL, Spark, Sedona) while gaining spatial awareness at the table level — no need for custom file handling or geospatial indexing setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Iceberg Matters for Spatial Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Iceberg brings all the essentials of modern data lake management — schema evolution, ACID transactions, partition pruning, and time travel.\n",
    "Wherobots builds on this foundation to add spatial intelligence directly into the table layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Native Spatial Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "    Geometry and raster columns are first-class types — not just blobs or strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This means:\n",
    "    - You can save Sedona DataFrames with geometry or raster columns directly to Iceberg tables.\n",
    "    - Query them with familiar functions like `ST_Intersects`, `ST_Within`, or `RS_Clip`.\n",
    "    - Work with both in-database rasters (stored in memory) and out-of-database rasters (linked to GeoTIFFs or COGs on S3).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Spatial Statistics and Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each Iceberg data file stores spatial metadata — including minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) for geometry and raster columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This allows the query engine to:\n",
    "    - Skip irrelevant files that fall outside your spatial filter (spatial pruning).\n",
    "    - Push down bounding-box filters to the scan layer, reducing data read from storage.\n",
    "    - Speed up spatial joins by comparing file-level extents before loading data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Spatial Partitioning and Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "    Spatial transformations (like tiling, grid partitioning, or bounding-box bucketing) can be used to organize data.\n",
    "    This helps co-locate nearby geometries and tiles, reducing shuffle and improving performance in spatial joins or aggregations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Query Optimization and Pushdown\n",
    "\n",
    "    WherobotsDB uses Iceberg’s metadata to push down both spatial and temporal filters:\n",
    "    - Spatial filters (`ST_Intersects`, `ST_Within`) are evaluated at the metadata level.\n",
    "    - Raster metadata and specific bands can be selectively read (projection pushdown)."

    "# Wherobots Fundamentals - Constructing\n",
    "\n",
    "WherobotsDB provides a powerful set of functions to construct geometries. You can either create them from scratch using raw coordinate values (literals) or by parsing standard geospatial data formats like WKT and WKB.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating from Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions build geometries directly from numerical inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ST_MakePoint(x, y, [z], [m])`: Creates a **Point** geometry from its x and y coordinates. You can also optionally provide a z-coordinate (for elevation) and an m-coordinate (a measure value).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ST_MakeEnvelope(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)`: Creates a rectangular **Polygon** that represents a bounding box, or \"envelope,\" from the coordinates of two opposing corners.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ST_LineStringFromText(text, delimiter)`: This function builds a LineString from a flat string of comma-separated coordinates, like `'x1, y1, x2, y2, ...'`. This provides a fast way to create line geometries directly from raw text data without needing the formal structure of WKT.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ST_PolygonFromText(text, delimiter)`: Similarly, the ST_PolygonFromText function creates a Polygon from a flat string of comma-separated coordinates. For a valid polygon, the sequence must form a closed ring by ensuring the last coordinate pair is identical to the first (e.g., `'x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x1, y1'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating from Standard Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions parse common text-based or binary geospatial formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ST_GeomFromWKT(text)`: The primary function for constructing any geometry type from its **W**ell-**K**nown **T**ext (WKT) representation. This is one of the most common ways to ingest geometries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ST_GeomFromWKB(binary)`: Creates a geometry from its **W**ell-**K**nown **B**inary (WKB) representation, which is a compact, machine-readable alternative to WKT.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating from Other Geometries\n",
    "\n",
    "This function combines existing geometries into a single feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ST_Collect(geometry_array)`: Takes an array of geometries and aggregates them into a single multi-part geometry (e.g., `MultiPoint`, `MultiPolygon`) or a `GeometryCollection`. This is useful for grouping related features together. This is an essential function because direct spatial operations on arrays are often limited, so ST_Collect consolidates the individual geometries into one object that can then be analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "While these are common examples, they are not the only constructor functions available in WherobotsDB. We will now look at examples for `ST_MakePoint`, `ST_LineStringFromText`, `ST_Collect`, and `ST_MakeEnvelope`."

    "# Wherobots Fundamentals - Spatial Predicates\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial predicates are functions that test the relationship between two geometries, returning `TRUE` or `FALSE`. They form the core of most spatial analysis, allowing you to filter data or create joins based on how geometries interact with each other. Understanding the exact logic of each predicate is key to performing accurate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore some of the most essential predicate functions in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## ST_Intersects(A, B)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most general-purpose spatial relationship, returning `TRUE` if two geometries **share any space at all**. This includes touching at a single point on their boundaries or overlapping in any way. It's the opposite of `ST_Disjoint`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Use Case:** Finding any parcels that intersect with a specific road.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## ST_Contains(A, B) and ST_Within(A, B)\n",
    "\n",
    "These two functions are opposites and describe a \"spatially-inside\" relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `ST_Contains(A, B)` returns `TRUE` if geometry **A** completely encloses geometry **B**. No part of B can be outside of A. Think of a cookie inside a cookie jar; the jar contains the cookie.\n",
    "  * `ST_Within(A, B)` returns `TRUE` if geometry **A** is completely inside geometry **B**. It's the reverse of `ST_Contains`. The cookie is within the jar.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key detail is that the boundaries of the geometries cannot simply touch; at least one point of the inner geometry's interior must fall inside the outer geometry's interior. For example, a line that lies perfectly on the boundary of a polygon is not *contained* by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Use Case:** Finding all the schools (`ST_Within`) a specific city district (`ST_Contains`).\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## ST_Overlaps(A, B)\n",
    "\n",
    "This predicate is more specific than `ST_Intersects`. It returns `TRUE` only if two geometries **partially intersect** and are of the **same dimension**. For example, two overlapping polygons will return `TRUE`, but a line crossing a polygon will not. Critically, neither geometry can be completely contained within the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Use Case:** Finding sales regions that have a partial overlap, which might indicate a territory dispute.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### ST_DWithin(A, B, distance, [useSpheroid])\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of just testing a direct spatial relationship, `ST_DWithin` checks for **proximity**. It returns `TRUE` if the two geometries are **within a specified distance** of each other. This is extremely powerful for \"buffer\" style queries and is highly optimized to use spatial indexes, making it much faster than calculating the exact distance for every pair of geometries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distance Calculation: Spheroid vs. Euclidean\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional `useSpheroid` flag is crucial as it controls how the distance is calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`useSpheroid = true` (Spheroidal Distance):** This method should be used for geographic data (latitude/longitude). It calculates the more accurate \"great-circle\" distance on a curved surface. When this is enabled, the distance unit is always in **meters**, and the calculation is performed between the centroids of the two geometries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`useSpheroid = false` (Euclidean Distance):** This is the default behavior. It performs a simpler, \"flat-earth\" distance calculation. The unit of the `distance` parameter in this case is the same as the unit of the data's Coordinate Reference System (CRS). For accurate results, you should first transform your data into a projected CRS appropriate for distance measurements (e.g., a UTM or State Plane system).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Use Case:** Finding all ATMs within 500 **meters** of a specific address using geographic coordinates (`useSpheroid = true`), or finding all competing stores within 2,500 **feet** of a location using a projected State Plane CRS where the units are in feet (`useSpheroid = false`).\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few of the many powerful predicate functions available in WherobotsDB. You can find the complete list in the [official documentation](https://docs.wherobots.com/latest/references/wherobotsdb/vector-data/Predicate/)."

    "# Wherobots Fundamentals - Spatial Joins (Range Joins)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand spatial predicates, you can use them to perform one of the most powerful operations in geospatial analysis: the **spatial join**. While a standard join uses a key like an ID to match rows (`tableA.id = tableB.id`), a spatial join combines data from two tables based on the spatial relationship between their geometries. This is a type of \"range join\" where the condition isn't simple equality but a spatial test, such as `ST_Intersects(A.geom, B.geom)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of a spatial join is enrichment: adding attributes from one spatial dataset to another based on their shared location.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Spatial Joins Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial joins allow you to get insights from your data **as if location itself were a column you could join on**. They let you combine completely different datasets using their shared space as the common link, which unlocks powerful analytical capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contextual Enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a table of customer addresses (points) and a separate table of county demographics (polygons). These tables have no common ID column. A spatial join lets you \"enrich\" your customer data by transferring the demographic information from the county polygon that each customer point falls within. You could then analyze customer behavior by county income level, population density, or any other demographic metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answering Complex Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, spatial joins are how you answer real-world questions that involve location. For example:\n",
    "* Which of our stores are located in flood-prone areas?\n",
    "* What is the average property value for parcels within 500 meters of a new transit line?\n",
    "* How many competitors are within a 10-minute drive of each of our locations?"
